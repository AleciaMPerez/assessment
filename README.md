# assessment

## Description

My assessment project quizes the user with four questions. If answered correctly, the user is awarded points, if answered incorrectly, time is deducted from the timer. 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?


## Installation

One can load my code by going to GitHub and selecting the green CODE button and then copy to the clipboard the HTTPS URL. Use the command "git clone" to clone the repository. Then enter "code ." to open Visual Studio. 

## Usage

How the project is supposed to work, is that the user is to select the start button and the timer will begin to count down, an the user is presented with the first question. The answers will appear as buttons. When the correct answer is selected, the user earns points; when the incorrect answer is selected, the user losses time off the timer. When all the questions have run through, or if the timer runs out of time, the user is presented with the score and the game is over. 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
